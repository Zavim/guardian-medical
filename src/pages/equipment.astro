      <p>
        Are you looking to purchase refurbished equipment? Is your site in need
        of reliable rental options heading into flu season? Is your clinical
        engineering department overworked and in need of equipment depot repair?
        We can help! Guardian Medical Equipment works with a vetted supply chain
        of vendors throughout the US.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why pay middleman fees? We buy used medical equipment, and “stay in our
        lane.” Guardian Medical Equipment will use credits earned by you to
        assist in paying for patient ready equipment at no additional cost to
        you.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can give you multiple dealers, with whom we’ve worked, to help your
        team.
